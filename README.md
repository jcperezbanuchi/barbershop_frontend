<h3>Approach / Purpose of App</h3>
<br>
<h4>Approach</h4>
<p>
The approach we took for our app is a Single Page Application. Our SPA has MVC file structure with full CRUD for the appointments schema. 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>The purpose of my app is to allow users to add, edit, delete, and view the barbers appointments. This appointments includes first and last names, phone numbers, email, preferred contact, date and time of the appointment. It's a great way for a busy barber to have a page where anyone who wants to get a haircut to  get their appointments. This app/website was created to give the customers a way to get their appointment without having to call or going in person to the barbershop. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
At this point in the app, I was able to render our login/register inputs, add new appointment, read appointments, edit appointments and delete. Although I can render our login/register inputs, I've yet to figure out how to get the login authentication with tokens. 
</p>

<h3>Unsolved Problems / Notes For Self</h3>
<br>
<h4>Unsolved Problems</h4>
<li>Login/Register authentication-being able to render only our login inputs before displaying the user appointments.</li>
<br>
<h4>Notes To Self
<ul>
<li>Needs a signup/login page with an encrypted password and authorization.</li>

</ul>
